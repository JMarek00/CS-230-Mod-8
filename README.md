Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client expressed a desire to create a game that adheres to a client/server architecture, ensuring compatibility across various operating systems. Java is the preferred choice for its exceptional portability, thanks to its reliance on a runtime environment.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I made some significant errors, such as the instance where I assembled three distinct versions instead of consolidating the various iterations into a single usable document. I did come to this realization later, which taught me the importance of carefully reviewing project requirements.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

A design document plays a crucial role in establishing a definitions and traceability matrix for developers. It serves as one of the initial documents in which we discuss the client's requirements and provide the entire project team with insights into the development process and its associated requirements.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

In hindsight, I would have chosen to go back and generate a single iteration of the document by diligently revising each section and updating the version number accordingly.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Our client holds a pivotal role in the project. They possess invaluable insights into what is essential for the project's success, making it imperative for us, as developers, to gain a comprehensive understanding of their requirements. As professional engineers, this is our primary responsibility. We are the experts who are committed to finding the optimal solutions and delivering them accurately from the outset.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I would prioritize the creation of a comprehensive behavioral and functional model of the software. To facilitate this, we could utilize UML design tools to visually represent our concepts and effectively communicate them with other project managers and developers. Soliciting feedback is essential, regardless of the nature of the software application.

These tools are refined through input received from the client, aligning with the collaborative approach we've learned in this class. It has been an excellent educational experience, offering us valuable insights into industry-standard practices that will prove invaluable in the private sector.
